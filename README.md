# mahalanobis-AD

This project is an attempt to implement anomaly detection algorithm from the paper "Modeling the Distribution of Normal Data in Pre-Trained Deep Features for Anomaly Detection"  [1]. This is intended for learning purposes and NOT for production (please refer to the original. The purpose of this project is to detect anomalous (defect) images from multiple inputs by using EfficientNet as its feature extractor. From the extracted feature vectors, the Gaussian distribution of the training set (all normal data) is predicted. The mean of this distribution serves as the centre point of Mahalanobis distance calculation for novel data (testing set containing both normal and anomalous images). If the calculated Mahalanobis distance M is higher than the threshold t set from evaluating the resulting ROC curve, the image is classified as anomalous. For more detailed explanation of the algorithms, please refer to the original publication.
